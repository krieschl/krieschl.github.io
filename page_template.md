## About Me

I am an undergraduate student in Civil Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  
I am interested in 'data analytics', and `Python programming`. ALong my academic journey I have gained a curiosity about how data analytics and computational tools can enhance decision-making in infrastructure design, project management, and sustainability.

## Projects

### Project 1: 
[Project 1 PDF](Cive202_Spring2025_Project4_GroupB_WrittenSummary.docx.pdf)  
In this Project, I gained a deeper understanding of multiple skills and concepts. I learned how data analysis can influence and potentially bias the interpretation of risk, specifically in the context of natural disasters. In using the National Risk Index (NRI) dataset and conducting a sensitivity analysis, I learned how to assess existing methodologies and explore alternative approaches to calculating risk. We extensively cleaned the data given to us and merged datasets, dealt with missing values, and used Python to generate a proposed risk definition. Creating a new risk definition challenged me to think critically about what determines “risk” and how drastic it can
vary depending on what is considered a priority.

Beyond the technical skills that were learned over the course of this project, my ability to communicate complex data decisions clearly and ethically was strengthened. Justifying our definition of risk required careful documentation of our work and thoughtful reflection on how different interpretations of risk can lead to unethical practices within varying communities. Unequal funding or policy implications for communities can be detrimental and defining a practical and fair definition of risk can mitigate this. I became more aware of how bias can be embedded not just in code, but also in the definitions and frameworks that determine how communities are at risk, which directly impacts the funding and aid dispersed to them. This project highlighted the responsibility that comes with data analysis, specifically when using risk analysis to ensure that real communities are adequately taken care of in the face of a threatening
natural disaster—regardless of the scale comparatively.

### Project 2: 
[Project 2 PDF](CIVE202_Spring2025_GroupK_Project3_Summary-1.docx.pdf)  
In this Project, the task was to create a set of visual representations regarding the comparisons of varying categories from the data provided in the NHTS and NGSIM files. The NHTS file contains data regarding variables such as vehicle details, travel details, household characteristics, etc. On the other hand, the NGSIM file consists of data regarding the behaviors of specific drivers. The visuals presented in the following report contain relevant information to be presented for the transportation planning meeting. The information contains trends regarding transportation usage as well as driving behavior. Using python code, five graphs were created, including a bar graph, a histogram, a box plot, and two time-series plots.

This project strengthened skills in Python, particularly with data analysis libraries, and to clean, manipulate, and visualize real-world datasets. In producing a professional report tailored to a transportation planning audience, translating raw data into clear, actionable insights using visual storytelling, I was able to further strengthen my writing skills and gain experience in communicating clear and concise results to a client. I was also able to apply critical thinking to identify meaningful variables, compare categories, and design visuals that best represented trends for decision-making
